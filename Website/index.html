                This is Game1's game for the DDD trimester 2 AWC<br>
                We decided to make a top down RPG/Roge-lite surounding the campus and the daily life of a student.<br>
                Our main gole for this project was to help new or perspective students to fermilierize themselvs with both teaching staf and the diferent buildings around campus to help in the proces for getting used to their new life as a student at the university.<br>
                We mainly focused on Computer Science students as this would alow us to use our own experiance as well as help minimise the amout of work we would do while still compleating our main gole of educating.<br>
                More sumbject specific building and staff would be posible to add to the game in later updates as we focused on creating reusable systems to ease the process of developing the world and the game play of out game.
